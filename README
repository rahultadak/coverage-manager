coverage-manager
================

Web app for management and report generation of coverage
***Always run the tool in production cluster only!***

1. In constants change tmp_files directory to an existing directory
2. Make sure that the tmp_files directory is read write permitted

4. Checkout the generic directory for the array_runner file. This file alone is also enough
syntax: "svn co http://cam-svn2.cambridge.arm.com/svn/ippd/cpudv/suites/generic/tags/generic_WW_49_13_RC1/tools/bin"
5. Add it to the path : Make a local bin directory and link this file inside the directory
syntax: "set path = ($path /path/to/dir1)"

Requires Modules:
